I installed aws cli on my computer and saved my credentials in the credential file in my local computer ,in the Gitpod, but
I need to be more comfortable saving credentials in the Gitpod account.
I have mac so I folllowed mac installation instruction in local machine.

sudo installer -pkg ./AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
which aws
